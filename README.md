HTML_project_Indopedia
======================
This is a project which I worked on when I was in school and was learning HTML. I had this concept of a encyclopedia along the lines of the popular Encyclopedia Britannica CD series. I based my encyclopedia on India. This was done when I was in school and so , some of the facts might be outdated and the writing style is somewhat jingoistic and ultra-nationalist (What can I say, I was a patriotic kid :P ) .So kindly excuse the glitches in the non-technical department

Execution :
============
1) First of all, download all the files and place them into one folder
2) Second , click on Indopedia.html
3) I cannot upload the images and sound , so they won't work . Apart from that, everything should work fine .
